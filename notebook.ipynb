Model building (part ii)\n<p>Let's continue building our model. So far our model has two convolutional layers. However, those are not the only layers that we need to perform our task. A complete neural network architecture will have a number of other layers that are designed to play a specific role in the overall functioning of the network. Much deep learning research is about how to structure these layers into coherent systems.</p>\n<p>We'll add the following layers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/pooling/#maxpooling2d\"><code>MaxPooling</code></a>. This passes a (2, 2) moving window over the image and downscales the image by outputting the maximum value within the window.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d\"><code>Conv2D</code></a>. This adds a third convolutional layer since deeper models, i.e. models with more convolutional layers, are better able to learn features from images.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout\"><code>Dropout</code></a>. This prevents the model from overfitting, i.e. perfectly remembering each image, by randomly setting 25% of the input units to 0 at each update during training.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#flatten\"><code>Flatten</code></a>.

Fully connected layer where every input is connected to every output (see image below).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout\"><code>Dropout</code></a>.
